## Overview

The **Plant Disease Detection** application is an Android app developed using Kotlin. It enables users to identify diseases in plants through image analysis using machine learning techniques. The app offers a user-friendly interface for capturing or selecting images, analyzing them, and providing solutions to detected diseases.

## Features

- **Image Analysis:** Capture images or select from gallery to analyze and detect crop diseases.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes TensorFlow Lite and machine learning models to classify diseases.
- **Suggested Solutions:** Provides suggested remedies or actions to mitigate detected diseases.
- **User Authentication:** Secure email and password authentication powered by Firebase.
- **Cloud Storage:** Store user data and analysis results in Firestore for easy access across devices.
